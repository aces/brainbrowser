# Handlequery
Loads Handlebars templates (and partials) using jQuery. This project is kind of a fork of [jQuery-handlebars](https://github.com/71104/jquery-handlebars) with some methods added:

- Preloading templates, to avoid the paradigm caused by async/ajax
- Append to a div  
- Prepend to a div
- Do not add, just call a callback function to use the generated string when ready

Thats pretty much it.
